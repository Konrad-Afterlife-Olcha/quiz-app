# quiz-app

Application contained in this repository is simple project, in which i used Node.js and Express framework in back-end and simple javascript and html in front-end.

It's my first project when I use simultaneously back and front-end of my application. Questions are stored in backend, so user should not see questions and correnct answers, even when using Network tool in browser.

This project will grow in time, by modifing front-end, so the page will look similar to popular Millionaires TV show.

If you want to run this page, you need to clone this repo to a new folder, and type "npm i" in console. Then just type in console: "node app.js" and open localhost:3000 in your browser.
